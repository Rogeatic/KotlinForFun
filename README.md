# Overview

{I wanted to get a little bit of practice with Kotlin because I've never used it before. I want to widen my experience and understand more languages.}

{The software I wrote really doesn't accomplish any task, it only was there to help me understand how Kotlin works.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{I set up the kotlin environment in visual studio code with my M1 macbook using brew.}

{I didn't really use any librarys, just kotlin alone.}

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

{I could see myself making a real project that tries to accomplish a task, but for this one, it's just a random math tester. Here's some ideas.}

- A simple banking system
- Some sort of loggin checker with libraries.
- a counter app
